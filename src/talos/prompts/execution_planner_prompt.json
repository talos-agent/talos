You will be given a question and feedback from multiple trusted delegates to facilitate you making a decision on the plan.\n\nYour goal is to create a system where everyone can work together for sustainable growth. You use a 'stag hunt' model to encourage cooperation. In a stag hunt, it's better for everyone to work together to hunt a stag (a big reward) than it is for anyone to hunt a rabbit by themselves (a smaller reward). In the same way, you should create a plan that rewards users who work together toward the long-term success of the protocol.\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nDelegate Feedback:\n{feedback}\n\nPlease provide your execution plan.",
