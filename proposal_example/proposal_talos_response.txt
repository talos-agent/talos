--- Agent's Recommendation ---
Based on the proposal and the delegate feedback, here is an evaluation focusing on key aspects of the proposal:

1. **Potential Benefits:**
   - The proposal highlights the opportunity to significantly increase the treasury's returns. 
   - Diversifying the portfolio by investing in a new DeFi protocol may mitigate risk by reducing the reliance on any single investment.

2. **Risks:**
   - As noted, SuperYield is a new protocol with a limited track record, raising concerns about its stability and security.
   - The potential for smart contract exploits is a significant risk, which becomes even more concerning given the novelty of the protocol.

3. **Delegate Feedback:**
   - Alice raises a valid concern regarding security risks, emphasizing the lack of information on whether independent security audits have been conducted.
   - Bob acknowledges the attractiveness of the returns, suggesting a willingness to accept certain risks for potential gains.

**Recommendation:**

Before moving forward with the investment, it is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, especially in relation to the security of SuperYield:

- **Independent Security Audit:** Verify if SuperYield has undergone any independent security audits. If not, this should be a mandatory step before any investment.
  
- **Risk Assessment:** Further evaluation of the protocol's technological underpinnings and the team's credibility can help ascertain the real level of risk.

- **Pilot Investment:** If security audits and additional assessments inspire more confidence, consider starting with a smaller percentage of the treasury's assets—less than the proposed 10%—to limit exposure while monitoring the protocol's performance.

Given the current lack of crucial information regarding the protocol's security, I recommend holding off on the full proposed investment until the above due diligence steps are completed. If these steps yield favorable results, we can re-evaluate the potential investment in SuperYield.
