        **Proposal: Invest in a new DeFi protocol**

        **Description:**
        This proposal suggests that the treasury invest 10% of its assets in a
        new DeFi protocol called "SuperYield". The protocol promises high
        returns through a novel liquidity mining strategy.

        **Justification:**
        Investing in SuperYield could significantly increase the treasury's
        returns and diversify its portfolio.

        **Risks:**
        As a new protocol, SuperYield has a limited track record and may be
        vulnerable to smart contract exploits.
